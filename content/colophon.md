This is the class website for Web Type at RISD, Spring 2021 with Marie Otsuka.

The material and site structure adapts interactive and web-related curriculums developed in collobaration by Chris Hamamoto, running in tandem with CCA’s Interactive 1. It is influenced by the work of Laurel Schwulst, Minkyoung Kim, and previous iterations RISD’s GD for the Web, Wintersession Web Design, and Web Progamming classes. 

The typeface is an unreleased variable typeface (name to be determined) designed with the spirit of the class: creative coding. Although a monospace, it also draws from characteristics of handwriting traditionally found in italic forms, making a mechanical and clunky script. It is a work-in-progress and will change over the course of the semester.

The site is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the full code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/marieotsuka/webtype-spring2021/) and is hosted via Github pages.

The website will evolve as we progress through our class — please check back often for up to date resources.
