[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based repository hosting service based on the Git version control and source code management system. GitHub allows individuals and teams of programmers to manage, share, store and make editable revisions to projects. We will be using Githubâ€™s code sharing and publishing service to store our class projects. 

* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and make a repository for this class.
	- This will become part of the url for where upload your projects
	- Avoid spaces in the repository name
