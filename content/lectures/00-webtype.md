“[Artists] have to start understanding the anatomy of machines, the language of machines, their nature, and to re-route them into functioning in irregular ways to create works of art with the machines themselves, using their own means.”
 — Bruno Munari: 1938 Manifesto del Macchinismo


# The Web
## Web infrastructure

Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, launched [The World Wide Web Project](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) in 1989. The project was initially created to streamline distribution of information among scientists around the world. Berners-Lee devised the system of hypertext (or links.) This first website was dedicated to host information about the World Wide Web itself.

The web works through the hypertext protoccol.
Ted Nelson proposed another alternative model for the internet namec Xanadu — this model fundamentally sdiffered from the current model by using two-way linking. See: [The Curse of Xanadu](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/)

> The computer world is not just technicality and razzle-dazzle. It is a continual war over software politics and paradigms. 

"With ideas which are still radical,
we fight on."


Ted Nelson, Xanadu

The internet is a network of connected computers with the primary purpose to share information. It works as bunch of conversations between clients and servers.
- **Web Client:** Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc..)
- **Web Server:** Internet-connected computers running server software, serving web documents as requested.  

Despite [popular depictions](https://noahveltman.com/internet-shape/) of the internet as a massless, nebulous entity, it requires a massive physical infrastructure powered by  electrical energy, including data centers, servers, airconditioners, and [cables](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/10/technology/internet-cables-oceans.html).

## Web as medium

From the begining stage of the web, [artists](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) embraced the browser as a platform. It nodes of [personal expression](https://www.cameronsworld.net/), or [abstract painting](http://www.abstractbrowsing.net/). Artists could even used the [infrastracture of the web](http://xn--9l7a.com/) itself.

It is in this spirit that we will engage in typographic explorations.

### Web languages

3 essential technologies (front-end web development) determines what we see and interact with on the web.

1. Content in HTML / `.html`
2. Form in CSS / `.css`
3. Behavior in Javascript / `.js`


Back-end technologies are used to compile several sources of the website together, whether through a database or static site generator. CMS (content management systems) like Wordpress are an example of systems that integrate all of this: how the information is collected, stored, and compiled into a website. 

In our class, we will be focusing on frontend languages to develop the skills needed to shape text within the browser.
