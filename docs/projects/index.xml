      <description>Documentation Develop a single webpage that provides a link to each project you’ve completed this semester. This index page will serve as a homepage for this class. You might also include exercises or alternate drafts that you experimented before developing the final version of your website.

      <description>“My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.</description>
