			<h1>Project 4: Editorial</h1>
			<time>March 30, 2020</time><p>The next phase is our final project — the goal is to engage in editorial design on the web, developing a collection of texts as as a publication. Below are several directions on how you might go about doing this.</p>
<p>General requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typeset at least 12 longform articles</li>
<li>Design at least 2 types of article layouts, in addition to the homepage</li>
<li>Consider what kind of viewing modes are available for</li>
<li>Consider the relationship between images &amp; words</li>
<li>Experiment with how we navigate from one article to another</li>
<li>Develop a robust typographic identity system, paying careful attention to typographic hierarchy and refinements</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="a-web-publication--anthology" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> a) Web Publication / Anthology</h2>
<p>Consider a current area of research. Collect at least 12 full-length articles around this topic. Use the website as a way to organize a large amount of content.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You might also consider a Project 1 as a starting point for this project; consider what additional texts to collect / generate to develop a full publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering our limited direct library access, Anastasiia Raina and James Goggin has collected a large library of <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EtAYaHu31TZs-NalYJovUMusFSQxm7Vc">readings to browse</a> on Google Drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are stuck on collecting content, you could go through a Wikipedia chain: follow a series of 12 wikipedia links to typeset within your website. (Random fact: if you keep clicking the first linked word, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy">you’ll end up on “philosophy”</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="b-open-letters" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> b) Open Letters</h2>
<p>Consider your website as an outlet to the world around you. Create website as a way to document your day-to-day experience admist the current pandemic crisis. What images did you see? What articles did you read? What’s been on your mind? What questions do you have?</p>
<p>Use this project to write HTML as a daily practice: the length of each post might range from just a few sentences to a full-length essay, but there should be at least one entry every day.</p>
<p>As your content grows, develop the design and framework that contains all of your documentation. How does your website evolve over time?</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible adaption: consider this as a public exchange between one other student, in which you both are pushing to the same website / Github repository. Alternate between days that you push and publish to the repository to establish a regular schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c-propose-your-own-project" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> c) Propose your own project</h2>
<p>Option C is more like an independent study, in which you will develop your own plan and scope of your new website. You must craft a detailed proposal, including a timeline that outlines a schedule of deliverables for each week.</p>
<p>Some examples of independent projects might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a website for a hypothetical festival / events series</li>
<li>Learn how to develop a theme to customize an existing CMS</li>
<li>Develop an information visualization project using APIs and JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="timeline" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Timeline</h2>
<h3><a id="week-1-planning" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Week 1: Planning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collect content (texts, images, videos, etc.)</li>
<li>Map out the information architecture
<ul>
<li>Macro-level: what are the overaching sections of your website?</li>
<li>Micro-level: what are is the meta-information for each article?
<ul>
<li>i.e. <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>template type</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine and sketch out different templates (layout formats) in Illustrator / InDesign. It might be something like:
<ul>
<li>Homepage (A list of articles)</li>
<li>Layout 1 (Article)</li>
<li>Layout 2 (Interview)</li>
<li>General Page (About page)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sketch out some style palettes to different versions of your typographic identity system</li>
<li>We will review your proposal document and your sketches next week</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="week-2-develop-site-prototype" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Week 2: Develop site prototype</h3>
<ul>
<li>Translate your PDF mockups into HTML / CSS
<ul>
<li>Using the structure developed in week 1, flesh out the templates / content-type-specific layouts for each.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Populate and style as much of your content as possible</li>
<li>Process your other assets — do your images need to be cropped, processed?</li>
<li>We will review your live prototype of the entire website next week</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="week-3-add-interactivity-css-illustrations" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Week 3: Add interactivity, CSS illustrations</h3>
<h3><a id="week-4-develop-into-responsive-platform" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Week 4: Develop into responsive platform</h3>
<h3><a id="week-5-refine" class="anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a> Week 5: Refine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Final Crit: May 7</li>
