      <description>This is the class website for Web Type at RISD, Spring 2021 with Marie Otsuka.
The material and site structure adapts interactive and web-related curriculums developed in collobaration by Chris Hamamoto, running in tandem with CCA’s Interactive 1. It is influenced by the work of Laurel Schwulst, Minkyoung Kim, and previous iterations RISD’s GD for the Web, Wintersession Web Design, and Web Progamming classes.
The typeface is an unreleased variable typeface (name to be determined) designed with the spirit of the class: creative coding.</description>

      <description>Documentation Develop a single webpage that provides a link to each project you’ve completed this semester. This index page will serve as a homepage for this class. You might also include exercises or alternate drafts that you experimented before developing the final version of your website. As you organize / reorganize your Github repository, make sure to double check that all links, including assets such as fonts and images, are properly linked.</description>

      <description>“My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.</description>

      <description>“[Artists] have to start understanding the anatomy of machines, the language of machines, their nature, and to re-route them into functioning in irregular ways to create works of art with the machines themselves, using their own means.” — Bruno Munari: 1938 Manifesto del Macchinismo
The Web Web infrastructure Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, launched The World Wide Web Project in 1989. The project was initially created to streamline distribution of information among scientists around the world.</description>
