      <description>This is the class website for Web Type at RISD, Spring 2021 with Marie Otsuka.
It is running in tandem with CCA’s Interactive 1, a class developed in collaboration with Chris Hamamoto, and the site structure and materials are in dialogue with this class. It is influenced by the work of Laurel Schwulst, Minkyoung Kim, and previous iterations RISD’s GD for the Web, Wintersession Web Design, and Web Progamming classes. Special thanks to Kelsey Elder for sharing his materials on type design and technology.</description>

      <description>“Technology inherits the politics of its authors, but almost all technology can be harnessed in ways that transcend these frameworks. Even in its harmful and chaotic state, it is still possible to marvel at the opportunities afforded to us through design.” – Cade Diem
 Over the course of the next few weeks, you will design and develop a simple tool that operates on the web: one that considers the values its built upon, and questions common expectations about how we behave.</description>

      <description>“ &amp;hellip; in any context, large or small, designing the medium is managing the potentials and relationships between objects, the activity or disposition immanent in their organization.” – Keller Eastering
 In this project, you will create a variable font, considering the axes of variation as a medium. You are not only designing the visual instances of letterforms — you are designing the relationship with the typographer (or anyone who uses the font.</description>

      <description>As an exercise in making form with CSS, we’ll construct (at least) three letters in CSS. Start with the letters n o and d and try to express them as div elements in CSS.
Be deliberate with the positioning of your shapes, and experiment with CSS properties such as: border, border-radius, transform, overflow
 when absolutely positioning elements, be sure to wrap the group in a position: relative so that the positioning is relative to the letter, instead of the whole document  This exercise lends itself to 2 approaches.</description>

      <description>To familiarize ourselves with HTML and CSS, we’re going to dive into the code of existing websites, and “hack” them. Your most helpful tool in coding is going to be the “Inspector.” Learning to use this tool will provide key insights into how your browser is reading the HTML/CSS that you write.
In this exercise, we’ll be using Google Chrome for its inspector tools. Firefox and Safari also have this function available as well, but the Chrome inspector has many useful features.</description>

      <description>“My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.</description>

      <description>Common errors to watch out for when troubleshooting:
HTML  Are your HTML elements wrapped in open and close tags? Are your HTML elements properly nested? Do your attribute values have quotation marks around them? Are your directory paths correct? Double check your link syntax.  CSS  Do you have opening and closing brackets? Does your property and value pairs have colons in between them? Do you have a semicolon at the end of each declaration?</description>

      <description>Tag a tag is used for creating an element, which consists of the name of an HTML element in angle brackets. (i.e. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; for paragraph.)
Element An element is a part of a webpage. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag. (i.e. &amp;lt;h1 class=&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Heading &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;)
Attribute An attribute extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form name=value, such as defining the link location (&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;index.</description>
